We will use function pointers to control algorithmic choices.  The selection of 
functions will be done in header files, in order to minimize the presence of 
macro/condition statements in the function bodies.  This is to increase the readable of 
functions so that users may more easily learn how a function works.  The 
maze of function calls (the algorithm) determined by a set of macro values 
will be expressed in header files, all in one place, so that users can figure 
the algorithm out in one place.  


Macros should be used to remove repeated blocks of code.  For instance, see the "SET_IZ_PARAMS()" macro 
defined in metric.h. 

When editing new or existing code, please follow the naming conventions and indentation present.
