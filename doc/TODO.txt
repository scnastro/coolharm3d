TODO List for future development :

-- move gradually to have decisions made by #define statements in
   options.h to be executed via function pointers instead of #if
   statements. 



MULTIPATCH-specific todo:
-- implement run-time parameter file parser because MPMD runs cannot accept command-line arguments
   -- have it first set just the master-branch-level commandline params
   -- have it set the multipatch patch id too


-- start with master branch then implement new MP stuff ( MP code << master branch code) ; 
--
